## Review Questions

These are the questions that we should ask when reviewing a homework submission.

* Is the app in one of the languages listed in the instructions? If not, did the applicant get special permission to use something else?
* Does the submittions include instructions for getting the assgignment up and running locally.
* Does the app meet each of the user story requirements set in the assignment
* Is the code well organized?
  * Is it split into multiple methods and views in an appropriate way?
  * Is there a clear split between the command line program and libraries?
  * Does the code include comments when necessary to explain what's going on.
* Does the code avoid repeating similar blocks of code for similar tasks?
* Does the code use third party libraries and tools as appropriate?

### Bonus Points

These are not expected as a baseline, but their presence is a good thing.

* Does the app handle loading and error states gracefully?
