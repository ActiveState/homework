## Review Questions

These are the questions that we should ask when reviewing a homework submission.

* Does the app meet each of the requirements set in the assignment
* Is the code well organized?
  * Is it split into multiple methods and views in an appropriate way?
  * Does the code include comments when necessary to explain what's going on?
  * Do the methods and varibales include type signatures
* Does the code avoid repeating similar blocks of code for similar tasks?
* Does the code use third party libraries and tools as appropriate?
* Does the submission include instructions for getting the assignment up and running locally.
* Does the app use semantic HTML for the information it displays

### Bonus Points

These are not expected as a baseline, but their presence is a good thing.

* Does the app handle loading and error states gracefully
* Does the app handle missing data gracefully
* Does the app handle different sizes of viewports well
