## Review Questions

These are the questions that we should ask when reviewing a homework submission.

* Is the submission in one of the formats listed in the instructions? If not, did the applicant get special permission to use something else?
* Does the submission include documentation covering the requested explanations?
* Is this documentation comprehensible by someone with only basic knowledge of data representation?
* Does the documentation contain enough detail for us to understand how the schema is useful?
