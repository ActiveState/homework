Thank you for your interest in working with ActiveState as a developer. This
programming assignment will help us to evaluate your skills relative to our
working environment and is used as a primary tool in our hiring process. Later
on in the hiring process we will have one of our developers pair with you on
making changes to your code, fixing bugs, etc.

We expect this assignment to occupy no more than 3 hours of your time.
We are primarily looking for high-quality documentation and we recognize
that you may not have time to fully polish your work, so focus on
documentation before code tests and other niceties.

We strongly encourage the use of third party tools and packages as you
work on this assignment.

We are also to accept automation solutions provided in the following
languages:

* Bash
* Perl
* Tcl
* Python
* Ruby

If you would like to use a different language, please contact us before
continuing with this assignment.

## Time Limit

We'd like you to complete this assignment within one week of receiving
instructions to do this from your recruiting contact. However, we
understand that this may not always be possible, for any number of
reasons. If this poses a problem for you, please let your recruiting
contact know what timeline works for you.

## Assignment

Document and automate building Python 3.5.4, the `gevent` python packqge
and a reasonable selection of their dependent libraries on either CentOS
7 or Ubuntu 18.04.  You should write detailed notes on downloading and
building each component by hand, provide a script which automates this
process and provide documentation on how to use this script and extend
it for other extensions.

When selecting dependencies to build, prefer libraries which change often
and/or are likely to have security issues and steer away from libraries
which are tightly bound to the system.  For example it is not necessary
to rebuild glibc from source, but it is desirable to rebuild OpenSSL.


## Sharing Your Code and Docs With Us

We do not want your solution available on the public Internet. **Do not
put this code into a public repo in order to share it with us.**

You can share it with us in one of two ways:

* Make a private repo and share it with us. You should have already been told
  who to invite if we asked you do this homework.
  * Note that while GitHub charges for private repos, BitBucket and GitLab
    both offer private repos as part of their free plans.
* Send an email containing a zip or tarball attachment. You can send this to
  your recruiting contact at ActiveState.
